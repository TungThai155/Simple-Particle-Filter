# Simple-Particle-Filter
-	Run source.py code
-	Recommend running with Bay Map for better results (I set the seed so that you can have the same performance as mine â€“ find the drone within 80 moves), Bay Map is more consistent than other map since Mario and City Map have more clutter
-	Recommend to just hold enter until the particle are formed.
-	The distance of the highest weighted particle and the drone will be printed on the screen.
